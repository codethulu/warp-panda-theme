## Installation
- First, you will need to create a themes folder if you have not already. You can do this simply using `mkdir -p ~/.warp/themes/`
- Now you simply need to move the .yaml file into the themes folder. You can do this by typing in `cp ~/Downloads/warp-panda-theme/Panda_Syntax.yaml ~/.warp/themes/`, replacing the source path with wherever you have downloaded this theme.
- Restart Warp, then open the theme picker using `CTRL + COMMAND + T` or using `COMMAND + P` to open the command pallete, and entering 'Open Theme Picker'
- You should now be able to select the Panda Syntax theme!
